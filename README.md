# Sinusoidal Soundscapes

## What your project is/does (and what it's called)
My project is called Sinusoidal Soundscapes, and it is based on the Oscillart YSWS by Athena Award. Users can enter the 7 natural notes (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G), and the website will play all of the notes while displaying the corresponding sine wave (it also has a glow-in-the-dark effect!). Users can also change the volume, color, and waveform to customize their project. There is also a recording button.

## Why you made your project
I made this project because it seemed like a fun way to get back into web development. It has been so long since I have used JS, HTML, and CSS, so it was a helpful refresher. Also, I have never done anything like this before, so the combination of math and music was nice!

## How you made your project
I wrote my code on GitHub Codespaces, and I followed the Oscillart YSWS guide to create most of my site. I used W3Schools for help with CSS and HTML.

## What you struggled with and what you learned
One thing I struggled with was figuring out how to use GitHub. Although I have some previous programming experience, I have never actually used GitHub before. Learning the process of creating a new branch of code, committing changes, and then pushing it back into the main branch was very confusing. However, after using the Athena Award's Intro to Git workshop slides and Google, I now mostly understand how to use GitHub.
